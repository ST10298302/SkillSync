# Testing Strategy for SkillSync App

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the SkillSync application, including unit, integration, regression, and performance testing approaches.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid principle:

```
    /\
   /  \     E2E Tests (Future)
  /____\    
 /      \   Integration Tests
/________\  Unit Tests
```

- **Unit Tests**: 70% - Fast, isolated tests for individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: 20% - Tests that verify multiple components work together
- **Regression Tests**: 8% - Tests that prevent previously fixed bugs from reoccurring
- **Performance Tests**: 2% - Tests that verify app performance under various conditions

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests (`__tests__/utils/`, `__tests__/components/`, `__tests__/context/`)

**Purpose**: Test individual components, functions, and contexts in isolation.

**Coverage**:
- Component rendering and behavior
- Context state management
- Utility functions
- Service layer functions

**Example**:
```typescript
it('should render skill info correctly', () => {
  const { getByText } = renderWithProviders(<SkillCard {...baseProps} />);
  expect(getByText('React Native')).toBeTruthy();
  expect(getByText('70%\nProgress')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### 2. Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/`)

**Purpose**: Test how multiple components and contexts work together.

**Coverage**:
- Complete user journeys
- Context interactions
- Navigation flows
- Data flow between components

**Example**:
```typescript
it('completes full user journey: signup → add skill → update skill → delete skill → signout', async () => {
  // Test complete user workflow
  // Verify state consistency across contexts
  // Test navigation between screens
});
```

### 3. Regression Tests (`__tests__/regression/`)

**Purpose**: Prevent previously fixed bugs from reoccurring.

**Coverage**:
- Edge cases that caused crashes
- Race conditions
- Memory leak scenarios
- Error handling improvements

**Example**:
```typescript
it('should not crash when process.env is undefined (previously caused crashes)', async () => {
  // Temporarily remove process.env
  delete (globalThis as any).process;
  
  // Should not crash, should handle gracefully
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useAuth(), { wrapper });
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(result.current.loading).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### 4. Performance Tests (`__tests__/performance/`)

**Purpose**: Ensure the app performs well under various conditions.

**Coverage**:
- Large data set handling
- Concurrent operations
- Memory usage
- Rendering performance

**Example**:
```typescript
it('should handle large numbers of skills efficiently', async () => {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  
  // Add 100 skills
  const addPromises = Array(100).fill(null).map((_, index) => 
    result.current.addSkill({...})
  );
  
  await Promise.all(addPromises);
  
  const endTime = performance.now();
  const totalTime = endTime - startTime;
  
  // Should complete within performance threshold
  expect(totalTime).toBeLessThan(3000); // 3 seconds
});
```

## Running Tests

### Individual Test Types

```bash
# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run only regression tests
npm run test:regression

# Run only performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run all tests
npm run test:all
```

### Test Options

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:unit -- --watch

# Run with verbose output
npm run test:integration -- --verbose

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests for CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)

The Jest configuration is organized into projects for different test types:

```javascript
projects: [
  {
    displayName: 'unit',
    testMatch: ['<rootDir>/__tests__/utils/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}'],
    testTimeout: 10000
  },
  {
    displayName: 'integration',
    testMatch: ['<rootDir>/__tests__/integration/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}'],
    testTimeout: 20000
  },
  // ... other test types
]
```

### Performance Testing Setup (`jest.performance.setup.js`)

Provides utilities for performance testing:

- `performance.now()` for timing measurements
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance thresholds
- Performance test utilities

## Test Utilities

### `test-utils.tsx`

Provides a consistent testing environment:

```typescript
export const renderWithProviders = (
  ui: React.ReactElement,
  options?: Omit<RenderOptions, 'queries'>
) => {
  return render(
    <ThemeProvider>
      <AuthProvider>
        <SkillsProvider>
          <LanguageProvider>
            {ui}
          </LanguageProvider>
        </SkillsProvider>
      </AuthProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>,
    options
  );
};
```

### Mock Services

All external services are mocked for testing:

```typescript
jest.mock('../../services/supabaseService', () => ({
  SupabaseService: {
    signUp: jest.fn(async (email: string) => ({ user: { id: 'u1', email } })),
    signIn: jest.fn(async (email: string) => ({ user: { id: 'u1', email } })),
    // ... other methods
  }
}));
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Async Testing

Always use `act()` and `waitFor()` for async operations:

```typescript
await act(async () => {
  await result.current.signIn('test@example.com', 'password');
});

await waitFor(() => {
  expect(result.current.isLoggedIn).toBe(true);
});
```

### 2. Test Isolation

Each test should be independent:

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  // Reset mocks and state
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  // Setup test environment
});
```

### 3. Meaningful Assertions

Test behavior, not implementation:

```typescript
// Good: Test user-visible behavior
expect(result.current.isLoggedIn).toBe(true);

// Avoid: Testing internal state
expect(result.current._internalState).toBe('authenticated');
```

### 4. Performance Thresholds

Set realistic performance expectations:

```typescript
// Should complete 10 cycles in reasonable time
expect(totalTime).toBeLessThan(5000); // 5 seconds

// Memory increase should be reasonable
expect(memoryIncrease).toBeLessThan(10 * 1024 * 1024); // 10MB
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions (Future)

```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: npm run test:unit
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        run: npm run test:integration
      - name: Run Regression Tests
        run: npm run test:regression
      - name: Run Performance Tests
        run: npm run test:performance
```

## Testing Scripts and Results

### 1. Unit Testing

**Components tested**: SkillCard, StreakCounter (streakCalculator utility)
**Contexts tested**: SkillsContext, AuthContext
**Focus areas**: Rendering, props handling, state management, CRUD operations, user interactions (button presses, form submissions)

**Outcome**: All unit tests passed. Components render correctly with provided data and state updates propagate as expected. Contexts manage state properly and handle authentication and skills management operations correctly.

### 2. Integration Testing

**Scenarios tested**: 
- Complete user journey: signup → add skill → update skill → delete skill → signout
- Authentication state changes across contexts
- Skills state management with authentication
- Navigation between app screens and tab navigation

**Outcome**: All core user flows work as intended. Contexts integrate properly, state persists correctly across operations, and no blocking issues discovered. The app maintains consistent state when switching between authenticated and unauthenticated states.

### 3. Regression Testing

**Scenarios tested**:
- Edge cases that previously caused crashes (process.env handling)
- Race conditions and concurrent operations
- Memory leak prevention during rapid context mounting/unmounting
- Error handling for non-existent skill IDs
- Special characters and very long text handling

**Outcome**: All previously fixed issues remain resolved. The app handles edge cases gracefully, prevents race conditions, and maintains stability under stress conditions.

### 4. Performance Testing

**Scenarios tested**:
- Rapid authentication state changes (10 cycles)
- Concurrent authentication requests (20 simultaneous)
- Large skill datasets (100-200 skills)
- Bulk operations (50 skills updated concurrently)
- Memory usage during rapid context operations
- Rendering performance with large skill lists

**Outcome**: All performance tests pass within acceptable thresholds. The app handles large datasets efficiently, processes concurrent operations without degradation, and maintains stable memory usage.

### 5. Coverage Summary

**Core functionality coverage**:
- Authentication, skills management, progress tracking, theming, and dashboard functionality have comprehensive test coverage
- Integration testing confirms end-to-end feature readiness
- Performance testing validates app scalability and responsiveness
- Regression testing ensures long-term stability

**Remaining areas for future sprints**:
- UI component testing (AnimatedInput, AnimatedLogo, DiaryItem, etc.)
- Advanced error handling scenarios
- Analytics view testing
- End-to-end user journey testing on actual devices
